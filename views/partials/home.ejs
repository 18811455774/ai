		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of computer science techniques that gives your software -- and therefore your products -- super powers.</p>
		<p>Building on our <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/">Primer on Artificial Intelligence</a>, this microsite is intended to help newcomers (both non-technical and technical) begin exploring what's possible with AI. We've met with hundreds of Fortune 500 / Global 2000 companies and startups asking: "How do I get started with artificial intelligence?" and: "What can I do with AI in my own product or company?"</p>

		<h2>What Can AI Do?</h2>
		<p>AI software can recognize the objects inside pictures, tell you if people are delighted or frustrated with your product by reading reviews, automatically drive cars from point A to Point B.</p>
		<p>We walk through some examples. While this playbook is written for a general audience, we've shared our code and data sets on <a href="https://github.com/a16z/ai">Github</a> to encourage others to experiment and share their work.</a></p>
