		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of computer science techniques that, as Stanford professor <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg">Andrew Ng</a> is found of saying, gives your software super powers.</p>
		<p>Building on our <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/">Primer on Artificial Intelligence</a>, this microsite is intended to help newcomers (both non-technical and technical) begin exploring what's possible with AI. We've met with hundreds of Fortune 500 / Global 2000 companies, startups, and government policy mak<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg">link text</a>ers asking: "How do I get started with artificial intelligence?" and "What can I do with AI in my own product or company?"</p>
		<p>This site is designed as an resource for anyone asking those questions, complete with examples and sample code to help you get started.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg">link text</a>
		<p>While there are dozens of excellent tutorials available on the web (once you've figured out what library or API you want to use  - we've listed a few of our favorites in the Reference section), we felt a pre-tutorial -- a “Chapter 0” if you will, was missing: something that would help you survey the landscape broadly; to give you a sense of what's possible; and help you think about how you might use artificial intelligence techniques to make your software smarter, your users happier, and your business better.</p>
		<p><i>While this playbook is written for a general audience, we've written some sample code and shared both the code and data sets on <a href="https://github.com/a16z/ai">Github</a> to encourage those who want to play with some software to do so. Please send us feedback at <a href="mailto:a16z-ai-playbook@a16z.com">a16z-ai-playbook@a16z.com</a></i></p>
		<p>A big shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/diegodoval?=lang=en">Diego Doval</a> who built the site, wrote much of the code, and drafted the text based on some very high level, hand wavy guidance. He's exceeded expectations, as usual. Also, a hat tip to contributors <a href="https://twitter.com/deliprao?lang=en</a> at Joostware, <a href="https://twitter.com/markpalatucci?lang=en">Mark Palatucci</a> from Anki, and my partners <a href="https://twitter.com/smc90?lang=en">Sonal Chokshi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theweester?lang=en">Michael Wee</a> at a16z.</p>
