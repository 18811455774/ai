## Ways In Which Machines Learn

There are four major learning paradigms: _supervised_, _unsupervised_, _semi-supervised_, and _reinforcement learning_.

**Supervised Learning** depends on a set of pre-existing data that is "labeled" in that we already know what the output of the network is expected to be for each pattern it is given. The process of learning can then use an objective function to quantify the mismatch between the expected and the observed results, and the network's weights can be adjusted accordingly. It can be hard (read: expensive) to get the data, so you need to make sure the value of the prediction a trained model will make justifies the cost of getting the labeled data and training the model in the first place. For example, getting labeled X-rays of people who might have cancer is expensive, but the value of an accurate model that generates few false positives and few false negatives is obviously very high.

**Unsupervised Learning** uses datasets that aren't labeled to identify clusters of data based on a cost function to be minimized. The function does not necessarily lead to a straight classification problem, but perhaps to a filtering or mapping of data. The famous ["Google cat paper"](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html) which found cats and other things by watching lots and lots of YouTube videos is a great example of unsupervised learning. They didn't set out to cats, but the algorithm grouped video frames that had cats (and thousands of other objects from the 22,000 object categories defined in ImageNet) in them. 

**Semi-supervised learning** combines lots of unlabeled data with really small amounts of labeled data to learn a highly performant model. Our friend Delip Rao at the AI consulting company [Joostware](http://joostware.com/), for example, built a solution using semi-supervised learning using just 30 labels per class which got the same accuracy as a model trained using supervised learning which required ~1360 labels per class. This enabled their client to scale from 20 categories to 110 categories very quickly.

**Reinforcement Learning** depends on interaction between the system and an environment, and while there are similar elements at play the goals are related to an accumulation of action and environmental responses that are useful for planning or control problems. Watch this technique in action with a reinforcement learning system that [learned to play Super Mario Brothers like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4KBBAwF_bE).
