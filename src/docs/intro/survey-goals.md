# What Can AI Do For Your Software?

Think of artificial intelligence as a broad set of software capabilities that helps you make your software smarter. We think it's going to have as broad (and maybe broader) an impact on software as relational database technologies. It's hard to think of a company whose products or services you use today that aren't enabled by databases. Databases are inside just about every important piece of software you use each day. E.F. Dodd's [original research paper proposing the relational database](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf) was published in June 1970, Oracle [published its first commercially available Oracle V2 database](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/intro.htm#CNCPT88784) in 1979, and we've been building on top of this breakthrough for ever since. We're in the very early years of putting AI in all our software in the same we put databses in all our software, and the full maturing of this trend will unfold over decades, not months or even years.T

## Applications of AI

One way to think of what AI can enable to is look at what it will make cheap, as in easy to make and distribute and therefore ubiquitous. A HBR article titled ["The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence"](https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-simple-economics-of-machine-intelligence) published in November 2016 argued that AI would make predictions cheap. Let's expand on this idea. AI will amke predictions cheap, true, but it will make other things cheap as well:
* Enabling things that move to drive or fly or sail themselves
* Understand people and objects and their relationships in the real world
* Optimize complex systems, such as driving patterns or electricity consumption in data centers
* Create content, such as newspaper articles, tweets, music, Websites, movie trailers, and eventually entire movies
* Understand people, help people understand software, and help people understand each other 

For real world examples of all these, we've published [[Future of AI Vimeo]].

## Applying AI to Your Business

To get the most out of this survey, we recommend that you come up with a few concrete areas where you want to apply AI techniques. Having these in mind will ground your exploration in a concrete software product.

Here are a a few was you can brainstorm how AI can help:
* Throughout each phase or the product or service lifecycle 
* For each of the functional teams in your organization
* Achieve high-level business objectives
* For the most important products or services in your porfolio

Here is a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15NgdbcLrWWMumHD_inMKrtrnpPtqX_sPUQ9iGJ3eD9A/edit#gid=0) you can use as a template.
