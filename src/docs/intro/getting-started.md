# The a16z Artificial Intelligence Playbook

In July 2016, we published a [primer on artificial intelligence and machine learning](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/). Since then, we've met with hundreds of Global 2000 companies and startups asking, "how do I get started with artificial intelligence?" and "what can I do with AI in my own product or company?"

This playbook is designed as a resource for anyone asking those questions. There are dozens are excellent tutorials available on the Web once you've figured out what library or API you want to use (we've listed a [few of our favorites in the Reference section](ai/src/docs/reference/links.md)). But we felt a pre-tutorial, a Chapter 0 if you will, was missing: something that would help you survey the landscape broadly, to give you a sense of what's possible and how you might be able to use artificial intelligence techniques to make your software smarter, your users happier, and your business better. So we decided to create exactly that, complete with sample code to help you get started.

## Audience

We've written the survey specifically as a starting place for for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence. We assume you are involved in creating or managing or green lighting software and want to understand how AI can give your software super powers (as [Andrew Ng](http://andrewng.org) is fond of saying). We do **not** assume you have a computer science degree. The types of people we had in mind:
* A **software developer** trying to get a broad overview of the products and services available
* A **business analyst**, **product manager**, **marketing manager** or **consultant** who has heard that Machine Learning could help improve the product she is responsible for but doesnâ€™t have the time to go through all the options
* A **data scientist** looking to broaden their toolkit from basic statistical techniques to the latest and great AI toolkits
* A **line of business leader** trying to figure out the right way for their organization to put intelligence into their team's software, proceses, and culture  

Along the way, we'll discover software that will help you understand if your customers are excited, sad or disgusted by your products. We'll compare how the big public cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft fare versus startups in identifying what's in a picture. Then we'll fire up Google's TensorFlow and train a deep learning model that will give your iPhone the AI superpower of recognizing business cards.

For people who like linear tours, we've provided navigation links at the top and bottom of every page that guide from the first room to the end. Feel free to visit the [table of contents]() to get to the exact topic you want to explore.

A big hat tip to our friend [Diego Doval](https://medium.com/@diego.) who generated most of the code samples and some of the text in this playbook based on some very high level, hand-wavy guidance. As usual, he's exceeded expectations. Thanks, Diego.

Enjoy the journey. We're very bullish on the potential for artificial intelligence to make all our software smarter, easier to use, and a better [bicycle for our minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c).
