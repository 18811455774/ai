# The a16z Artificial Intelligence Survey

In July 2016, we published a [primer on artificial intelligence and machine learning](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/). Since then, we've hosted meetings with hundreds of Global 2000 companies and startups asking, "how do I get started with artificial intelligence?" and "what can I do with AI in my own product or company?"

This survey is designed as a resource for anyone asking those questions. There are dozens are excellent tutorials available on the Web once you've figured out what library or API you want to use (we've listed a [few of our favorites in the Reference section](ai/src/docs/reference/links.md). But we felt a pre-tutorial, a Chapter 0 if you will, was missing: something that would help you survey the landscape broadly, to give you a sense of what's possible and how you might be able to use artificial intelligence techniques to make your software smarter, your users happier, and your business better. So we decided to create exactly that, complete with sample code to help you get started.

We've written the survey specifcially as a starting place for for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence: software engineers, yes, but also product managers, consultants, business analysts, data scientists, even the AI-curious line of business owner or executive. Think of this as a docent-led tour of the most popular tools to AI-enable your aplications.

Along the way, we're going to explore software that will help you understand if your customers are excited, sad or disgusted by your products. We'll see how simple API calls can identify what objects are in an image. We'll show how to build your own iPhone app that cal tell you whether what you're pointing your camera at is a business card.

For people who like linear, one room at a time tours, we've provided navigation links at the top and bottom of every page that guide from the beginning to end. Feel free to visit the table of contents by hitting [[X to find the exact room you want to explore.
